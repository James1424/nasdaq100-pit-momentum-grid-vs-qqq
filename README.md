# Nasdaq-100 Point-in-Time Momentum Grid Backtest vs QQQ

This project compares Nasdaq-100 average-momentum strategies using five momentum windows:

- 3-month average momentum
- 4-month average momentum
- 5-month average momentum
- 6-month average momentum
- 7-month average momentum

For each momentum window, the project tests:

- Top 1 / Top 2 / Top 3 selected stocks
- 1 / 2 / 3 month holding periods
- Monthly decisions from 2016 to the latest available completed holding period

The README is automatically regenerated from the CSV outputs. For each momentum window, the README shows:

1. Backtest Yearly Compounded Returns
2. Benchmark Comparison Summary vs QQQ
3. Summary
4. Latest Top-3 Monthly Selections

The full monthly decision-level data is saved in `output/momentum_grid_detail.csv`.

## Method

- Stock universe: monthly point-in-time Nasdaq-100 constituents
- Decision date: first available trading day of each month
- Momentum definition: average of the previous N one-month returns based on month-start adjusted close prices
- Momentum windows: 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 months
- Buy price: adjusted close on the decision date
- Sell price: adjusted close on the first trading day after the selected holding period
- Portfolio return: equal-weighted average return of the selected stocks
- Yearly compounded return: non-overlapping compounding path starting from January

## Universe Rule

At every decision date, the project reconstructs the Nasdaq-100 list that was effective at that date and recomputes the momentum ranking only inside that universe.

If a component change happens after a monthly decision date, that change is not used until the next monthly decision. For example, if the index changes on May 18, the May 1 decision still uses the May 1 universe, while the June 1 decision uses the updated universe.

Data source for constituents and component changes: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq-100`.

**Interpretation note.** This point-in-time version can differ from a static-current-universe backtest. If a stock was added to the Nasdaq-100 after a decision date, it is excluded from that month even if it has strong momentum. This avoids look-ahead bias, but it also means results will not exactly match older projects that used today's Nasdaq-100 list for all historical months.

## 3-Month Momentum Strategy

### Backtest Yearly Compounded Returns

The table below uses non-overlapping compounding paths starting from January.
Hold 1M compounds monthly decisions Jan through Dec, Hold 2M compounds Jan/Mar/May/Jul/Sep/Nov decisions, and Hold 3M compounds Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct decisions.
The current year is labelled YTD when it is incomplete.
